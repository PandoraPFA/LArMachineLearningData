# SBND Feature Tool Sets
This document records the feature sets that are used in the current (sbndcode v09_37_01) PandoraSettings XML files. There are currently 3 MVAs run in SBND: Vertexing, PFO Characterisation, and SliceID. Note, however, that there are multiple versions of each of these that are run each with different parameter sets.

# Vertexing
### Region

### Vertex

# PFO Characterisation
- Length
- Straight Line Diff Mean
- Max Fit Gap length
- Sliding Linear Fit RMS
- Vertex Distance
- PCA Secondary-Primary Ratio
- PCA Tertiary-Primary Ratio
- Open Angle Difference
- Fractional Charge Spread
- Charge End Fraction
### No Charge Info
This version of the MVA is run when no collection plane information is available so the calorimetric variables (Fractional Charge Spread and Charge End Fraction) are excluded.

# SliceID
- Number of Final State PFOs
- Total Number of Hits
- Vertex Y (Vertical) Position
- Weighted Z (Beam) Direction
- Number of Space-Points in Sphere
- Eigenvalue Ratio in Sphere
- Longest Track Y (Vertical) Direction
- Longest Track Deflection
- Fraction of Hits in Longest Track
- Number of Hits in Longest Track
